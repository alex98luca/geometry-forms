# geometry-forms

This was my first approach to html, css and js, as well as git and github. 
At that time I did knew nothing about OOP concepts, or front-end development frameworks, I only knew a little bit of C language, with its structs, pointers and sorting algorithms.

In this tiny web site, if we can call it so, I experimented with colours ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 and a lot of creativity, to make it all work togheter.

I hope you'll enjoy my web designing skills 👨🏻‍💻🤣
